# Ansible role: complete_workflow
The collection [ibm_zos_zosmf](../../README.md) provides an [Ansible role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html), which is referred to as `complete_workflow`. This role is used for completing a z/OS workflow, either forcibly or idempotently.


## Role variables
The available role variables are described as follows.

### Defined by role
The following variables are defined by role. For the default values, see [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml).

- `force_complete` - Specify whether to complete the workflow instance forcibly or idempotently:
  - `forcibly (force_complete: True)` - Delete the workflow instance if it exists in the z/OSMF server. Create a new workflow instance and start it on each of the target z/OS systems. Periodically check the workflow status and return the final result when the workflow stops running.
  - `idempotently (force_complete: False)` - Create the workflow instance if it does not exist in the z/OSMF server. Start the workflow on each of the target z/OS systems. Periodically check the workflow status and return the final result when the workflow stops running.

- `complete_check_times` - The maximum number of time that is used for periodic checks of the workflow status.

- `complete_check_delay` - The interval time between periodic checks of the workflow status.

### Defined by module
